This is for `Linux`, `Mac OS`, or `Windows` Hosts.

The goal of this how to is to get you setup with a demo fast.

This demo is going to act like you have nothing already installed, if you already have docker or other tools installed feel free to skip the step listed.

Download these --> [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

If you use `Git Bash` for windows, please use the windows cmd, I am working on a fix!

Install docker, python, and git... Cool! (Skip this if you already have them installed)

Make a folder named `LocalAi` then run `git clone https://github.com/lunamidori5/localai-lunademo.git`

Run `Setup.sh` (Linux or Mac) or `Setup.bat` (Windows), this will setup everything for you.

Enjoy localai! (If you need help contact Luna Midori on Discord)
