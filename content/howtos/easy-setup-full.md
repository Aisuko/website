This is for `Linux`, `Mac OS`, or `Windows` Hosts.

The goal of this how to is to get you setup with a demo fast.

This demo is going to act like you have nothing already installed, if you already have docker or other tools installed feel free to skip the step listed.

Download these --> [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Demo Rar File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p2_-WdS15aVvR8yoJixvlg1t9nHgAhqQ/view?usp=sharing), [Demo Model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-13B-V1.2-GGML/resolve/main/wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin)

Install docker... Cool!

Unrar the demo rar file into a folder called `LocalAi`

Move the Wizard model into the models folder. Do not rename it.

Once you have moved that model into the models folder. Open a new CMD or Bash window.

Open on the (Linux or Mac) SH or (Windows) BAT file, this will install all of the things needed for the program.

Enjoy localai!
