- 23-05-2023: __v1.15.0__ released. `go-gpt2.cpp` backend got renamed to `go-ggml-transformers.cpp` updated including https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1508 which breaks compatibility with older models. This impacts RedPajama, GptNeoX, MPT(not `gpt4all-mpt`), Dolly, GPT2 and Starcoder based models. [Binary releases available](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/releases), various fixes, including https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/341 .
- 21-05-2023: __v1.14.0__ released. Minor updates to the `/models/apply` endpoint, `llama.cpp` backend updated including https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1508 which breaks compatibility with older models. `gpt4all` is still compatible with the old format. 
- 19-05-2023: __v1.13.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ updates to the `gpt4all` and `llama` backend, consolidated CUDA support ( https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/310 thanks to @bubthegreat and @Thireus ), preliminar support for [installing models via API](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI#advanced-prepare-models-using-the-api).
- 17-05-2023:  __v1.12.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Minor fixes, plus CUDA (https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/258) support for `llama.cpp`-compatible models and image generation (https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/272).
- 16-05-2023: ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Experimental support for CUDA (https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/258) in the `llama.cpp` backend and Stable diffusion CPU image generation (https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/272) in `master`.

Now LocalAI can generate images too:

- 14-05-2023: __v1.11.1__ released! `rwkv` backend patch release
- 13-05-2023: __v1.11.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ Updated `llama.cpp` bindings: This update includes a breaking change in the model files ( https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1405 ) - old models should still work with the `gpt4all-llama` backend.
- 12-05-2023: __v1.10.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Updated `gpt4all` bindings. Added support for GPTNeox (experimental), RedPajama (experimental), Starcoder (experimental), Replit (experimental), MosaicML MPT. Also now `embeddings` endpoint supports tokens arrays. See the [langchain-chroma](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/langchain-chroma) example! Note - this update does NOT include https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1405 which makes models incompatible.
- 11-05-2023: __v1.9.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ Important whisper updates ( https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/233 https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/229 ) and extended gpt4all model families support ( https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/232 ). Redpajama/dolly experimental ( https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/214 )
- 10-05-2023: __v1.8.0__ released! ðŸ”¥ Added support for fast and accurate embeddings with `bert.cpp` ( https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/pull/222 )
